										How to prepare for this class: Read select excerpts (<a href="resources/Aurobindo.pdf">pdf</a>) 
										from the works of Sri Aurobindo, a contemporary Indian 
										philosopher of the last century (1872-1950). Aurobindo writes at a point in time 
										much closer to us than thinkers such as Buddha or Nagarjuna. Try to see how he engages  
										with traditional themes of classical Indian philosophy, such 
										as the relationship between thought and matter, 
										illusion (Maya) and reality, self and the world, man and God.  
										Make sure you write in your diary points 
										of similarity and difference with other Indian 
										thinkers.

										Topics/questions to be discussed in class: 
										How does Aurobindo describe East and West (p. 578)? 
										What is the "integral view of the unity of Brahman" (p. 585)? 
										What is Aurobindo's attitude toward what he calls a "philosophy of world-negation" by thinkers 
										like the Buddha (p. 589)? What is the distinction 
										between higher and lower Maya (p. 597)?
