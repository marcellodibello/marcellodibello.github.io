						<p class="description"> 
							The literature on algorithmic fairness has examined exogenous sources of biases such 
							as shortcomings in the data and structural injustices in society. It has also examined 
							internal sources of bias as evidenced by a number of impossibility theorems showing that 
							no algorithm can concurrently satisfy multiple criteria of fairness. This paper contributes 
							to the literature stemming from the impossibility theorems by examining how informational 
							richness affects the accuracy and fairness of predictive algorithms. With the aid of a computer 
							simulation, we show that informational richness is the engine that drives improvements in 
							the performance of a predictive algorithm, in terms of both accuracy and fairness. The centrality 
							of informational richness suggests that classification parity, a popular criterion of algorithmic 
							fairness, should be given relatively little weight. But we caution that the centrality of 
							informational richness should be taken with a grain of salt in light of practical limitations, 
							in particular, the so-called bias-variance trade off.

							The legal scholar Henry Wigmore asserted that cross-examination is ‘the greatest legal engine ever 
							invented for the discovery of truth.’ Was Wigmore right? Instead of addressing this question upfront, 
							this paper offers a conceptual ground clearing. It is difficult to say whether Wigmore was right or 
							wrong without becoming clear about what we mean by cross-examination; how it operates at trial; what 
							it is intended to accomplish. Despite the growing importance of legal epistemology, there is virtually 
							no philosophical work that discusses cross-examination, its scope and function at trial. This paper 
							makes a first attempt at clearing the ground by articulating an analysis of cross-examination using 
							probability theory and Bayesian networks. This analysis relies on the distinction between undercutting 
							and rebutting evidence. A preliminary assessment of the truth-seeking func- tion of cross-examination 
							is offer at the end of the paper.

						When Statistical Evidence Is Not Specific Enough

							Many philosophers have pointed out that statistical evidence, or at least some forms of it, 
							lack desirable epistemic or non-epistemic properties, and that this should make us wary of litigations in 
							which the case against the defendant rests in whole or in part on statistical evidence. Others have responded 
							that such broad reservations about statistical evidence are overly restrictive since appellate courts have expressed 
							nuanced views about statistical evidence. In an effort to clarify and reconcile, I put forward an interpretive analysis 
							of why statistical evidence should raise concerns in some cases but not others. I argue that when there is 
							a mismatch between the specificity of the evidence and the expected specificity of the accusation, statistical 
							evidence—as any other kind of evidence—should be considered insufficient to sustain a conviction. I rely on different 
							stylized court cases to illustrate the explanatory power of this analysis.

							Suppose one hundred prisoners are in a yard under the supervision of a guard, 
					  		and at some point, ninety-nine of them collectively kill the guard. 
					  		If, after the fact, a prisoner is picked at random and tried, 
					  		the probability of his guilt is 99%. But despite the high probability, 
					  		the statistical chances, by themselves, seem insufficient to justify a conviction. 
					  		The question is why. Two arguments are offered. The first, 
					  		decision-theoretic argument shows that a conviction solely based on the statistics 
					  		in the prisoner scenario is unacceptable so long as the goal of expected utility 				  
					 		maximization is combined with fairness constraints. The second, risk-based argument 
					  		shows that a conviction solely based on the statistics in the prisoner 
					  		scenario lets the risk of mistaken conviction surge potentially too high. 
					  		The same, by contrast, cannot be said of convictions solely based on DNA 
					  		evidence or eyewitness testimony. A noteworthy feature of the two arguments 
					  		in the paper is that they are not confined to criminal trials and can in fact 
					  		be extended to civil trials.

						<a href="#" class="show-content "> Can Probability Theory Explain Why Closure Is Both Intuitive and Prone to Counterexamples? <span class="open close">&times;</span></a>

		                  <p class="description">  Epistemic closure under known implication is the principle that 
					  knowledge of A and knowledge of "if A, then B", together, imply knowledge of B. 
					  This principle is intuitive, yet several putative counterexamples have been 
					  formulated against it. This paper addresses the question, why is epistemic 
					  closure both intuitive and prone to counterexamples? In particular, the paper 
					  examines whether probability theory can offer an answer to this question 
					  based on four strategies. The first probability-based strategy rests on the accumulation
					  of risks. The problem with this strategy is that risk accumulation cannot 
					  accommodate certain counterexamples to epistemic closure. The second 
					  strategy is based on the idea of evidential support, that is, a piece of evidence 
					  supports a proposition whenever it increases the probability of the proposition. 
					  This strategy makes progress and can accommodate certain putative 
					  counterexamples to closure. However, this strategy also gives rise to a number 
					  of counterintuitive results. Finally, there are two broadly probabilistic strategies, 
					  one based on the idea of resilient probability and the other on the idea 
					  of assumptions that are taken for granted. These strategies are promising but 
					  are prone to some of the shortcomings of the second strategy. All in all, I conclude 
					  that each strategy fails. Probability theory, then, is unlikely to offer the account 
					  we need.</p>

		                  <p class="description">  According to the principle of epistemic closure, knowledge is closed under known implication. 
		                  				The principle is intuitive but it is problematic in some cases. 
		                  				Suppose you know you have hands and you know that 'I have hands' implies 'I am not a brain-in-a-vat'. 
		                  				Does it follow that you know you are not a brain-in-a-vat? It seems not; 
		                  				it should not be so easy to refute skepticism. In this and similar cases, 
		                  				we are confronted with a puzzle: epistemic closure is an intuitive principle, but at times, it does not seem that we know by implication. 
		                  				In response to this puzzle, the literature has been mostly polarized between those 
		                  				who are willing to do away with epistemic closure and those who think we cannot live without it. But there is a third way. 
		                  				Here I formulate a restricted version of the principle of epistemic closure. In the standard version, 
		                  				the principle can range over any proposition; in the restricted version, it can only range over those propositions that 
		                  				are within the limits of a given epistemic inquiry and that do not constitute the underlying assumptions of the inquiry. 
		                  				If we adopt the restricted version, I argue, we can preserve the advantages associated with closure, while at the same time avoiding the puzzle I've described. 
		                  				My discussion also yields an insight into the nature of knowledge. I argue that knowledge is best understood as a topic-restricted notion, and that such 
		                  				a conception is a natural one given our limited cognitive resources.</p>

		                  <p class="description">  Talks of incommensurable conceptual schemes typically allude to the following picture: there is reality that is inaccessible per se, on the one hand, and there is us, or different groups of people, accessing reality by means of incommensurable conceptual schemes, on the other. But what does it mean for two schemes to be incommensurable? And is incommensurability at all intelligible to us?   Donald Davidson famously argued that incommensurability is unintelligible. His argument first provides a definition of incommensurability, and then shows that incommensurability thus defined is unintelligible. I will argue, contra Davidson, that his definition of incommensurability does not lend any support to the unintelligibility claim.</p>

A legal (core) ontology can play an important role in the translation of existing legal knowledge bases to other representation formats, in particular as the basis for articulate knowledge serving. This requires that the ontology has a firm grounding in commonsense and is developed in a principled manner. We describe the theory and methodology underlying the LKIF core ontology, compare it with other ontologies, introduce the concepts it defines, and discuss its use in the formalisation of an EU directive. </p>

		                    I maintain that the correct answer is No. I argue that the prosecutor's burden of proof does not only consist in establishing the high probability of the defendant's guilt; it also consists in (1) establishing guilt with a resiliently high probability, and in (2) offerring a reasonably specific and detailed narrative of the crime. My account has applications to debates in epistemology  about lottery propositions, and to questions in legal scholarship regarding the use of statistical evidence in criminal trials. </p>

		                  <p class="description">Lottery propositions are well-known to epistemologists. Their peculiarity is that we don’t think we are in a position to know them, despite their high probability. Hawthorne in Knowledge and Lotteries (2004) formulated the following puzzle: (a) we do not think we are in a position to know lottery propositions; (b) we can deduce lottery propositions from other propositions which we think we are in a position to know; (c) so, if knowledge claims are closed under deduction, as many philosophers think they are, we should be in a position to know lottery propositions. In this paper I show that without denying that knowledge claims are closed under deduction, the tension between (a) and (c) can be resolved by using non-monotonic logic and by appealing to what I call “cognitive bracketing.”</p>

		                	<p class="description">Can a criminal defendant be convicted on statistical evidence if his probability of guilt is sufficiently high? A rich literature developed on this question over the years, yet many thought that it would be of limited practical interest because the possibility that a defendant be incriminated on statistical evidence alone seemed to be far-fetched. Things have changed, however. DNA evidence, a powerful form of statistical evidence, is now a common presence in the courtroom, and some defendants have been recently convicted on only DNA evidence. Unsurprisingly, this has revived interest in the question of whether a conviction is acceptable on statistical evidence alone.</p>

Prompted by studies showing that traditional forms of evidence, such as testimonies and fingerprints, are highly subjective and unreliable, legal scholars have explored ways to counter this problem, e.g. by adopting more demanding standards of admissibility or rules of weight. I will suggest that it is difficult to restrict the role of traditional forms of evidence in criminal trials without creating further complications. I will also discuss some of the dangers that statistical evidence poses for criminal justice.</p>

							<p class="description"> 
								Legal probabilism is an ongoing research program that aims to harness the powers of probability theory to analyze, 
								model and improve the evaluation of evidence and the process of decision-making in trial proceedings. 
								Despite its promise, significant hurdles exist in carrying out this program, and many have criticized it. 
								These critiques range from difficulties in assessing the probability of someone’s criminal or civil liability to the 
								dehumanization of trial decisions to misconstruing how the process of evidence evaluation and decision-making takes 
								place in trial proceedings. The seminar examines these current debates and their relevance to larger questions about

						<a href="#" class="show-content remove-top-border"> Race Causality Discrimination <span class="open close">&times;</span></a>
						<div class="animated fadeIn collapsible-description-div content-panel" style="display:none">
							<p class="description"> 
								Claims of racial discrimination and structural racism are ubiquitous today. 
								On one hand, studies in the social sciences show that, after controlling for variables 
								other than race, racial disparities still persist in incarceration, health outcomes and wealth. 
								Thus, race appears to be a key variable for explaining racial disparities. On the other, many 
								point out that, again after controlling for variables other than race, the same racial disparities 
								significantly decrease. Thus, they think that the explanatory role of race has been exaggerated. 
								This debate leaves out a crucial question, however. What causal and explanatory role (if any) 
								can race play in the first place? If, as many hold, race is a social construct emerging 
								from the fabric of social interactions, does it make sense to isolate it and control for 
								other variables?  The course aims to untangle the assumptions about the causality of race that inform the 
								ongoing debate about racial discrimination and structural racism. Readings will be drawn 
								from the literature in the social sciences on racial inequalities, the statistical 
								and philosophical literature on causality, and the philosophical literature 
								on theories of race.

						<a href="#" class="show-content"> The Common Ground <span class="open close">&times;</span></a>
						<div class="animated fadeIn collapsible-description-div content-panel" style="display:none">
							<p class="description"> 
								This seminar examines the idea of the common ground as a condition for meaningful disagreement, 
								valid reasoning, rational inquiry about matters of fact, and political decision-making. 
								The motivation for thinking about the common ground stems from the growing political polarization on issues 
								such as climate change, vaccines, abortion, race, the 1619 project, #MeToo, and more. 
								This polarization in people’s opinions, commitments, and values exists alongside deep 
								divisions in wealth, education, housing, health, lived experiences. 
								Seeking a common ground is sometimes touted as the solution to the problem of polarization, 
								and the lack of a common ground as its cause. On the other hand, attempting to overcome 
								polarization by seeking a common ground is sometimes considered the wrong way of addressing 
								the problem. But what is a common ground, in the first place? If it is the solution to polarization, 
								what kind of common ground should we be seeking? Is a common ground even possible or does 
								it necessarily lead to the exclusion of people’s identities? This seminar examines these 
								questions from a philosophical standpoint. It will not offer answers, but rather, a framework of analysis.

								This module examines how tools from AI can help judges make decisions. 
								Judges make decisions at several junctures of the justice system, pre- and post-trial. 
								Their decisions concern matters of fact as well as matters of law. 
								We will focus on decisions about matters of fact and examine three topics:
								1. Machine learning tools for risk assessment applied to decisions about bail, preventive detention and sentencing;
								2. Multiagent systems for deciding about the relevance and admissibility of evidence; and
								3. Argumentation structures and Bayesian networks for representing complex bodies of evidence.
								The module will also examine the different ways in which the judiciary can rely 
								on findings about matters of fact that are entirely or partially based on 
								automated elements, as well as the current legislative policies and case-law on the topic.
